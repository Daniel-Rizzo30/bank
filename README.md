The website fully works now! Routing needed to be changed after deploying, the
name of the repo needed to be put before all links - /bank/

Old update: ~~The website is up but something is wrong with how components are loaded. 
The API's arrays are loaded and output into the console, and state exists 
and has all parts that it should (check with inspect) but something else 
is wrong. I tried really hard to debug, but nothing has helped. 
Everything leads back to the instructions laid out in the document
that was linked in the Assignment 4 file.
